Fox Business Network correspondent Charlie Gasparino managed to get himself booted from the exclusive Sun Valley pow wow on Thursday after two run-ins with security. The tension began Wednesday night when Gasparino and two of his producers crashed a party that was off-limits to the press. Words were exchanged and they were ordered to leave by MSA Security’s Brian Coughlin, whose day job is with the NYPD bomb squad. Gasparino, who had flown in only hours earlier, said he had no idea the event was closed to reporters. Then, on Thursday, Gasparino got into a shouting match with the same security guard and was ordered off the grounds of the mountain resort — “You’re out of here,” Coughlin said. Gasparino was forced to do a stand-up Thursday afternoon from a roadside outside the resort as cars and trucks whizzed past. He tweeted this: “Irony of #fbnsunvalley: media conf closed to the media guarded by bullying and fat ex cops like the guy I told to stop bullying my producer.” Gasparino insisted that he was defending the honor of his female producer. “Listen, I know that these are big wigs, big moguls and they need a degree of security, but I’ve never seen a company like Allen & Co. hire a bigger bunch of storm troopers,” he told The Post. There has always been an uneasiness between the press and the conference organizers. But reporters complained that security was even more restrictive this year after they were banned from many parts of the resort where they once had access. On Thursday, Gasparino tweeted: He also insisted that all along he intended to stay only for one day. MSA Security declined to comment on the incident.
